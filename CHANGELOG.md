# Release Notes
## New Release 2026.1
This is the updated GREEN curriculum in the iSAQB Advanced Level portfolio. It provides methods and techniques for software architects to develop and operate CO2-efficient software, with an additional emphasis on designing AI systems that are both energy-efficient and sustainable.

In the GREEN module, participants learn to take a holistic view of the topic of green software. This begins with the role of IT in halting climate change, an introduction to current regulations, the requirements of various stakeholders, and the identification of areas for action in companies. From there, it moves on to measuring and monitoring CO2 emissions and energy consumption, before arriving at the core topic of software development. This central area covers the energy efficiency of various software architectures, energy-efficient data handling, and optimised algorithms. Another focus is on the influence of AI systems – from the development of resource-efficient models to the evaluation of the energy requirements of training and inference processes. In addition, the relationship between quality requirements and energy efficiency is analysed, for example, how performance, scalability and sustainability can be reconciled. Another important component is cloud computing, both in terms of selecting sustainable providers and the possibilities for low-carbon operation. Finally, options for improving energy efficiency in the development process are considered.

Changes from 2024.1 are:
* New chapter 8: Artificial intelligence and sustainability
* Swap of LG 5-2 and 5-3 (computational complexity before data structures & algorithms)
* Peak shaving removed from chapter 6 and included in chapter 8 only as an example
* Swap of LG 4-2 and 4-3 (methodologies first, then tools)
* Fluctuating carbon dioxide intensity added to chapter 1
* Water usage effectiveness and other key figures added to chapter 7
* Previous chapter 8 (energy-efficient development process) is now chapter 9
* English keywords standardised in all LGs
* Categories of measurement tools updated in LG 4-3
* Chapter 7 (Operation) streamlined, inclusion of GreenOps and Greenwashing
* Measurement of CI/CD pipelines moved from LG 4-4 to LG 9-2
* Literature updated for many chapters
