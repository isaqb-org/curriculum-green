# Release Notes
## Initial Release 2024.1
This is the new GREEN curriculum in the iSAQB Advanced Level portfolio.
It contains methods and techniques for software architects for the development and operation of CO2-emission-efficient software.

In this curriculum, software architects learn to take a holistic approach to the topic of green software. This begins with an examination of the role of IT in stopping climate change, an introduction to current regulations, a view of the requirements of various stakeholders and the identification of fields of action in companies. From there, it moves on to measuring and monitoring CO2 emissions and energy consumption and on to the core topic of software development. This central topic area includes the energy efficiency of various software architectures and basic concepts used, energy-efficient data handling, optimized algorithms and the influence and management of quality requirements in relation to energy efficiency. Another important component is the topic of the cloud, both in terms of provider selection and the options for low-CO2 operation. Finally, options for improving energy efficiency in the development process are considered.
